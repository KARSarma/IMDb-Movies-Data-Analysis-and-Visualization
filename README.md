# IMDb-Movies-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of IMDb movie data, focusing on various aspects such as ratings, genres, directors, and financial performance. Python was used for data analysis, while Tableau and Power BI were employed for visualizations.

## Dataset Complexity
The dataset includes diverse attributes like movie titles, genres, directors, release years, ratings, votes, and revenue. It required significant preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure data integrity. This step was crucial to prepare the data for comprehensive analysis and visualization.

## Data Analysis
Key analyses conducted include:

Descriptive Statistics: Examining basic metrics such as mean and median for ratings and revenue.
Correlation Analysis: Assessing relationships between different variables to uncover insights into how factors like ratings and revenue interact.
Genre and Director Analysis: Identifying patterns and trends within genres and directors that correlate with high ratings and revenue.
Additional analyses included:

Movies per Genre and Director: Visualizations showing the distribution of movies across different genres and directors.
Revenue and Rating Distributions: Analyzing how these metrics vary by year and genre.
Time Series Analysis: Tracking changes in average ratings and total revenue over time.
Predictive Modeling
Machine learning algorithms were employed for:

Revenue Prediction: Using linear regression to forecast movie revenue.
Rating Classification: Utilizing random forest to categorize movies based on ratings.
Success Prediction: Implementing logistic regression for binary classification of movie success.

## Visualizations
Both Tableau and Power BI were used to create compelling visualizations that provided clear insights into the data:

### Tableau Dashboard:
Top Directors and Genres: Highlighting the directors with the most movies and genres with the highest ratings.
Revenue vs. Rating Scatter Plot: Displaying the relationship between a movie's rating and its revenue, helping to visualize trends and outliers.
Revenue and Ratings Over Years: Showing trends in movie ratings and revenue over time, allowing for analysis of industry growth and changes.
### Power BI Dashboard:
Sum of Ratings by Genre: Illustrating which genres have the highest cumulative ratings, providing insights into viewer preferences.
Sum of Ratings by Director: Highlighting the directors who have received the highest total ratings across their films.
Count of Revenue by Year: Tracking revenue trends across years, showcasing financial growth in the industry.
Average Rating by Year: Displaying how average movie ratings have fluctuated over the years, indicating potential shifts in audience expectations or industry standards.

## Conclusion
This project showcases my comprehensive analysis of IMDb movie data, providing valuable insights into the film industry. By utilizing Python for data analysis and Tableau/Power BI for visualization, I effectively identified complex patterns and trends. This repository demonstrates my ability to handle large datasets, apply advanced analytical techniques, and create compelling visualizations, making it an excellent showcase of my skills for potential employers in data analytics and visualization.
